h2. Changes
* 1.3.5 -- Update to suit Chrome extension manifest 2. Also, removed the "My..." buttons as I don't use them.
* 1.3.4 -- Fix the feature introduced in 1.3.1
* 1.3.3 -- Start implementing add/read later via background page (i.e. no popup window). Work in progress, although progress is slow.
* 1.3.2 -- Small bug fix for saving bookmarks when ext is first installed, but content script is not loaded.
* 1.3.1 -- Initial use of local storage to allow you to 'draft' tags/descriptions (basically means you don't lose text you've entered in the popup, if you close the popup before saving the bookmark).
* 1.3 -- Initial implementation of Save Tab Sets feature.
* 1.2 -- Fixed problem with special characters in urls + other small bugfixes.
* 1.1 -- Added link to unread items and tightened margins.
